# Machine Learning Projects

This Repository contains Machine Learning Projects and Concepts:

**1. Regression:**

**2. Classification:**

ROC curves are appropriate when the observations are `balanced` between each class, whereas precision-recall curves are appropriate for `imbalanced datasets`.

ROC Curve:
   * It is a plot between false positive rate (x-axis) & true positive rate (y-axis) for a number of different threshold values between 0.0 and 1.0.
