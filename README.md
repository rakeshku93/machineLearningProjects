# **Machine Learning Projects**

This Repository contains Machine Learning Projects and Concepts:

## **1. Regression:**

## **2. Classification:**

`ROC curves` are appropriate when the observations are `balanced` between each class, whereas `precision-recall curves` are appropriate for `imbalanced datasets`.

ROC Curve:
   * It is a plot between **FPR** (x-axis) & **TPR** (y-axis) for a number of different threshold values between 0.0 and 1.0. 
   


## **3. Clustering:** 
   An attempt to group objects together based on similarity.



<br/>

## **4. Extras:**  
1. To check the information of packages installed in the environment using command line/jupyter:
   <br/>
   pip show <package1_name> <package2_name> <package3_name>
   <br/>
   **e.g: pip show pandas numpy scikit-learn**
<br/>
